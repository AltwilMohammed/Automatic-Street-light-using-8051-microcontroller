# Automatic-Street-light-using-8051-microcontroller
Generally, street lights are switched on for whole night and during the day, they are switched off. But during the night time, street lights are not necessary if there is no traffic. Saving of this energy is very important factor these days as energy resources are getting reduced day by day We need to save energy because most of the energy sources we depend on, like coal and natural gas can't be replaced. Once we use them up, they're gone forever. Saving power is very important, instead of using the power in unnecessary times it should be switched off. In any city “STREET LIGHT” is one of the major power consuming factors. Most of the time we see street lights are ON even after sunrise thus wasting lot of energy. This project presents a design and a prototype implementation of Automatic street light system using Proteus simulation tool to represent the hardware in addition to assembly Language as its controlling software. Our purpose of this project is to have a clear understanding of how to use Microprocessor in mini project ,how all the components combine and how it's controlled the software to perform its special task that was designed to do.
